<h1>COMP2007 - W2018 AM - Patient Records</h1>

<p>
            Through this website, patients can online check their doctor's name and their office location. Moreover, doctors can see the information
            of their patients. So, basically this site manages the patients and doctors data. In patients link, it gives the information of the 
            patients and also give their doctor's name. In the doctors link, it gives the information of the doctor like their education and office location.</p>

<p> In this I change the css of the website too.</p>

<p> For my assignment2 part-1, I make all the views where users can add, edit, or delete data PRIVATE, so only authenticated users can access them
     b.	On the Index views, anonymous users can view the list of data but cannot see the Create, Edit, or Delete links. 
     Also, I add social authentication for google, microsoft and facebook and store the api in web.config file.


<p>The live site is deployed to Windows Azure at <a href="https://assignmentdoctorsite.azurewebsites.net/">https://assignmentdoctorsite.azurewebsites.net/</a>.</p>
